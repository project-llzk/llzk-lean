## External Sources

The accepted remote branch was checked with `git ls-remote origin
refs/heads/felt-review-structural-close` from the VeIR repository and recorded
under `../veir/reviews/PHASE-01/evidence/accepted-remote-branch.txt`.

No web page, issue, or mutable branch name is trusted without the exact commit
hash above. For LLZK source facts, `origin/main` is accepted only through the
exact commit `db922857bc5a88a9107627ef6b36a8b5e57bc5c2`.

## Contextual Non-Canonical Material

These files remain design and review context, not Phase 1 pin evidence unless a
specific claim is revalidated against the accepted commit and recorded under
Phase 1 evidence:

- `README.md`
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/strategy-a-oracle.md`
- `docs/strategy-e-certificates.md`
- `docs/future-*.md`
- `docs/REVIEW.md`
- `.github/workflows/*.yml`
- Historical references to `llzkfelt_test1` in archived evidence or old notes
- Local `../llzk-lib` worktree files while the worktree remains at
